# SEP10 Freedom Project
by Christian Ramos

I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of science based on my learning of it in the past years of my experience science has really wanted me to explore what its about. 
The freedom project will be all about science and what website could be useful to help the world using science. The real reason why I choose this as my innovations in the topic of my choosing is because the world is in need of care.

I used Github to track what things I would love to do for science and whats its about. I also chose to independently study science in order to help me make by website.
