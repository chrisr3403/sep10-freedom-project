I used css variables from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties so I can reserch more about what I'm working with. I used the primary code for colors main-bg-color and primary-color: blue var(--primary-color) and background-color: #ADD8E6;.footer background-color: #4d582a; padding: 35px; for my SHABR to see what things I can create. The progress was very far as supposed to what limited css code I used but was worth it it had made some text background blue color. Challenges I faced was the color code as well as aligning the color I had a ah-moment to where I could not get the code as well thinking that I got it but it never appeared until I realized I did not see the flaw which was the () to close in the code so I fixed it. My questions I have is how will I be able to learn more about my css variables and how much more there is to explore about it how many code there is that can do more then just colors. What I will try to do next is properties and custom code and see how much I can be able to do with it.

I used css variables https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp so I can reserch more about what I need to use in order to perssue my goal. I used the code for border margin for bottom h2 { border-bottom: 2px solid #1e90ff; } h2 { border-right: 2px solid #1e90ff; } for my practaice to see what things I can make. The way it was set out was very succesful  as I used var to make things work even the color as I talked about on the previus Challenges and log 4. I faced challenges with aligning with var function and I had a ah-moment to where it was not aligning properly and how I put the code properly as well. questions I have is how will I use more of my tool code will it be very useful in a near future? Will it ever have code I have not learn yet? My question may not be answered but I can still try my tool more and what I will do next is look at more codes that I can use after I had finish my code for color and var.
