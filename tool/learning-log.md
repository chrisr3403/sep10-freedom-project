* I used css variables from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties so I can reserch more about what I'm working with. I used the primary code for colors main-bg-color and primary-color: blue var(--primary-color) and background-color: #ADD8E6;.footer background-color: #4d582a; padding: 35px; for my SHABR to see what things I can create. The progress was very far as supposed to what limited css code I used but was worth it it had made some text background blue color. Challenges I faced was the color code as well as aligning the color I had a ah-moment to where I could not get the code as well thinking that I got it but it never appeared until I realized I did not see the flaw which was the () to close in the code so I fixed it. My questions I have is how will I be able to learn more about my css variables and how much more there is to explore about it how many code there is that can do more then just colors. What I will try to do next is properties and custom code and see how much I can be able to do with it.
