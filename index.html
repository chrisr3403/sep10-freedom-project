I'm thinking An idea for the earth to have better defense techniques in space and for the earth to be well protected from outside danger.</strong> 
<p> Content: We can use defenses for the world and save mankind from harm. Here are some examples of what we could do for outside defense! Drones will be placed all over the orbit of earth with sensors.
The drones will contain a high concentration of power that is able to destroy a meteor. 
If a meteor passes through they will shoot heat seeking rockets to track the meteor and destroy it.
For context: Better quality of Space defenses for our planet to ensure a perfect safety from any harm outside the planet; this benefits both cities and worldwide problems for things that happen outside the world. This also benefits future generations to be creative and to do more and more of what these ideas we do now for them to benefit from.</p>

        <strong>I am thinking of a ground defense system in case the orbital strike defense does not work, we can have an inner protection in our planet for better security. </strong> 
Content: <p>The drones will have a large shield in case something hits them and they are able to send warning signals to an operating station.</strong> 
Ground space defense will be good for defending the earth it will be in close range and better to operate from below. People can operate it manually or make it automatic ( which I highly recommend). The ground forces are able to shoot a beam at the object any other objects like asteroids.  They may not be like the orbital strike defense but they get the job done!
