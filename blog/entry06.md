FP MVP 5/5/24

This blog will be about my FP MVP and what I did to tinker and use to create it. FP MVP is my website to showcase the things that needs to be created in life.
I used my tool css variables from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) a recommended site that I use my variables from. 
From my tool I used background-image it has given me the ability to make a background from a image or any images like a jpeg or png. 
FP MVP was all about space defences so I used background image to make a space background as well as change color to give it a purple tone. 
For my FP MVP I skill that I learned was partnership my two friends Simran and Nayer had helped me have ideas with my FP MVP. 
Simran gave a idea of a space background and we had talked about it and it was a good idea to put it she as well helped me with the css code.
Nayer had talked about adding Purple color to my FP MVP so it can look accurate with the theme it has showed me that Partnership is a skill
to have when it comes to collaboration especially with your classmates you can help one another or give recomendations to eachother.
Another code I used to make my FP MVP is  float: left; width: 50%; padding: 50px; height: 300px; this css allowed me to have the ability to put
for example my 2 accordion-items side by side instead one on top of the other it made it accurate towards my wireframe layout. 
About accordion I used [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/accordion/)
