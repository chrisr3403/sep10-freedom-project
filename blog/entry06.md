FP MVP 5/5/24

This blog will be about my FP MVP and what I did to tinker and use to create it. FP MVP is my website to showcase the things that needs to be created in life.
I used my tool css variables from [W3Schools]([https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp)) a recommended site that I use my variables from. 
From my tool I used background-image it has given me the ability to make a background from a image or any images like a jpeg or png. 
FP MVP was all about space defences so I used background image to make a space background as well as change color to give it a purple tone.
