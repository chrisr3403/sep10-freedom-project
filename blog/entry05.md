## My Tool update!

This blog will be a Continuation of the tool that you can use in css. It is called css variables from w3schools and I use the tool CSS Variables to tinker with the var and border This is good for color and background as well as paragraphs. My skill that I achieved was working on shabr with my partner Nancy we use css to edit color and border to make things more detailed we also used containers from boostrap to make the project detailed as possible! The method I used was w3schools and boostrap which gives me codes that are able to help me make things more detailed and better in my thoughts are to recommend these two to use. Another thing I had do is make the root which gives out color here you can tinker with the names variable. And incase it is sensitive make sure to add the (--) so no error. For more content CSS variables can have a global or local scope. Global variables can be accessed/used through the entire document, while local variables can be used only inside the selector where it is declared. Plus there is a root code to show a example root {--blue: #1e90ff;--white: #ffffff;} body { background-color: var(--blue); } h2 { border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue); } .container {color: var(--blue); background-color: var(--white);padding: 15px; to give a solid root.
