## My Tool css and Wireframe.

This blog will be a Continuation of the tool that you can use in css. It is called css variables from w3schools and boostrap as well developer.mozilla and I use the tool CSS Variables to tinker with the var and border This is good for color and background as well as paragraphs. My skill that I achieved was working on shabr with my partner Nancy we use css to edit color and border to make things more detailed we also used containers from boostrap to make the project detailed as possible! The method I used was w3schools here is a link source "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp" and devoleper mozzila "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties" and boostrap which gives me codes that are able to help me make things more detailed and better in my thoughts are to recommend these two to use. Another thing I had do is make the root which gives out color here you can tinker with the names variable. If it does not work make sure the {--blue: #1e90ff; --white: #ffffff;} - root code is correct for what purposes you use if for. Here is another takeaway I learned about containers is it splits into colums which makes it so you can make sections of things and make its background color. }.container { color: var(--blue); background-color: var(--white);padding: 15px;} this code allows the container to where be different color. You can use my source links to check them out. Another Skill I achieved was my mainly learning wireframe and its been a interesting one because on how you can create and make things like your FP or another thing I worked on of it is Mullertime which had me create plans of each of what I can create. To give more content to my tool my tool had been very useful for change of things like my text I used my tool to give my code better things such as box the box make it so you can have a box around your text I am still working on my skill for it and the technical real name is containers you can change color as well as size.
