# Entry 7

In this Entry I want to explain with my Website FP and my tool css varibales. I used css variables from the website [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp)
As I seen before with my css codes my time using it has been very useful for my projects
it had come to my attention that i learned how to make titles to be bigger with width and height and use class for color for a easier route.
I had come to a problem with my }.accordion-body {background-color: Purple;} this had issues where for some reason I used the id "accordion-header" for css 
and it would not show the respective color "Purple"
