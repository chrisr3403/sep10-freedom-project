In this Entry I want to explain with my Website FP and my tool css varibales. I used css variables from the website [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp)
As I seen before with my css codes my time using it has been very useful for my projects
it had come to my attention that I learned how to make titles to be bigger with width and height and use class for color for a easier route.
I had come to a problem with my }.accordion-body {background-color: Purple;} this had issues where for some reason I used the id "accordion-header" for css 
and it would not show the respective color "Purple". In a later time I had realized that I used my css varibles examples instead of its other code content that I have not learned yet.
From what I had gather from my presentation [Orbital Project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MgE5ckvnCsYslvEMAnhBOeX_9cTfN4FIWmho8_3ozSo/edit#slide=id.g2ddf232b3b4_0_0) 
I want to give a few takeways always make sure that you are USING your code not examples you may had read the actual code beforehand but make sure some of them is not a example. 
Another takeway on my presentation always make eye contact I have learned that eye contact will always be a good thing to do 
it will show the people you present in any indecation that you are presenting to them and just not looking at the screen all the time.
My next takeaway is when presenting make sure not to be so mixed up in slides because it will give a more confused on what you are doing. 
In my presentation it was very good to show to the people that you put time in this and you are explaining I felt this way explaining my project because I wanted to show off skills like
speaking a type of voice for presenting my FP project a formal voice a presenting voice. My Main skill is being very creative with my FP project I may had messed up on my tool
but the main thing I used was creative thinking for the FP Project like boostrap accordian and W3schools with my tools examples to use for the orbiting defenses.
I did another presentation for EXPO elevator pitch here is a link [Expo Elevator Pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noPdI-D3wfKnJr9Kn_khtRJILvSFmbQqFh1uZ8sdusQ/edit) 
this presentation was for our FP projects like the first scroll all the way down to see it.
It was all about sharing our projects to those higeher and lower grade then us as well as visiters and teachers.
My experence for this was very good I had 20 people come review me and even my friends and I had very good and positive reviews on each of my presentations.
My skill was answering their questions they asked me questions like "what made you make a project like this" I gave prime examples of the real life things that could happen to our 
planet.
A takeaway is always listen carefully to what others ask or say about your presentations you must understand what they ask or say so you can respond back to what they say.
The presentations have been a good experence to show what you created and give code examples and teach the people who are interested in sep for future of what they want to code or learn.
