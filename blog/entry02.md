## What ive learned
What ive learned so far is position absolute gives a element to the nearest ansester and set 50 px.
My understanding of it was a bit complecated at first but solving it and reseraching it later on was easy by far.

## How complex is it to research
When researching my avd it was not that difficult as it just requires you to research about something spefic in avd such as positioning or animation.
