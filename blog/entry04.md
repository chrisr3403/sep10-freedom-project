This blog will be about a tool that you can use in css and what I myself has used. It is called css variables from w3schools and I use the tool CSS Variables because you can tinker and switch variables to change the way the project and or anything else that must do with it like paragraph! This is actually very useful to achieve diffrent things for css and change the code in the css. My skill that I achieved was I edited the body paragraphs like the background color it has to have a certian code for a color like this as a example body {background-color: #1e90ff;} - it changes the background color. The method I used was freecodecamp which helps me know what I must use for the code to make the example color background work and sense it works and is a recommended methoed to use. Another thing I had use and actually fix is h2 {border-bottom: 2px solid #1e90ff; - makes a boarder under a sentence and it is useful for like a paragraph underline or a box also this code is one part to enable the background color and the border. Another code I learned is a syntax code called var var(--name, value)
